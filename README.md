Friday Night Funkin' Electron 

You can play Friday Night Funkin' online on Newgrounds and other sites, or even download a local version, but I thought it would be convenient to have a lightweight Electron app that uses the Newgrounds upload to run in a window without any NG padding.  
  
P.S. This is a very, very, lazy port that was just made from the quick start guide

# Setup
Download node for your platform, plus npm  
Run npm install  
Run npm start  
Congrats, you did it
